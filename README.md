This project is a Reddit clone.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag
for a production build.

## Deployment

Using `now-cli`

Installing `now`:
```
$ npm install -g now
```
To deploy a site with `now` is very easy:
```
$ cd dist # change into the dist folder
$ now
```
The now command should ask you a couple of questions (such as your email address) and youâ€™ll need
to check your email and click the link inside.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
